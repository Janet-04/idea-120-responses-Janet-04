## Project#3 Proposal

I am not sure if I will stick to this, but I was thinking about making a game/story of a plant's perspective at my house. My parents love gardening and they already began this season's gardening. So far, they have the plants indoors while they grow bigger and stronger, and the weather gets nicer outside. It would be interesting to give a plant some personification qualities or characteristics. I would like to explore and play with imagining how a plant feels or thinks about its own growth and the care that my parents provide them or don't provide them at times. The plant would have a perspective that is very playful.

At the same time, it would be very curious and confused about many things that are involved in the human life. Also, there would be the plant's perspective on the constant visits from the parent's child. In addition, I think it would be interesting to have two perspectives telling the same story, but the other would be the humans' perspective towards the plants. In other words, I feel like it would be interesting to see the confusion and perspective of a plant and what it beliefs is happening, in contrast to what is happening through the humans' eyes. However, the main character will remain the plant.
