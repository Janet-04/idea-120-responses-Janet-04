# Project 4 Proposal

For my portfolio project, each of my past projects will be displayed in different pages. In other words, I would want to make a "home page", where the four projects will be listed as tabs horizontally across the top area of the web page. My name and "2022 Portfolio" will be right under my name on the left side panel of the webpage. To provide a small preview, I would like to include at least one image of each project auto displaying in the center of the web page. The page for each project will be formatted the same. The heading will tell the specific project being displayed and an image or two will be included with a brief description. For instance, for project 1, I would include a screenshot of the website with the link either attached to the image or placed right below it. Below the image, I would have a brief description. For project 2, I would also just include a screenshot of how the video looks and a brief description below the image. For project 3, I would also include an image or two of the game and write a brief description. My fourth personal project will be a survey I created, which is going to be used in the summer when I decide to do a one-time sell of my handmade crochet plushies. I would display the page of this project the same, I would include 1-2 images and a brief description.
