# Entangled Response
It was interesting to see the different perspectives and artistic approches of different artists. In particular, Richard Wagner, Adolphe Appia, and Vsevolod Meyerhold with Lyubov Popova. Wagner created a theater that was specifically and carefully constructed for one of his theater-works called Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung). He used various physical and digital contemporary tools to enhance and execute the way the opera performed, which resulted in Gesamtkunstwerk. For instance, Wagner used artchitectural skills to create a theater in a way that "separates" the spectactor from the stage. He isolated the orchestra into a pit located below the stage, so it would be hidden from the spectators' view. He also used light to lighten up bodies within the stage to focus the attention on them specifically. Essentially, he wanted to facilitate the spectators' ability to focus on the opera by minimizing distractions (such as the orchestra). Interestingly enough, Adolphe Appia took a different approach than Wagner and preferred to not separate the audience and the stage and instead, united them. Furthermore, Appia used light differently. He used light to enhance the space within the stage. 

Meyerhold and Popova also created art that can be considered Gesamtkunstwerk. For example, Popova had a projection screen hanging from the ceiling, which served to display any additional information for the audience. She also created "...a labyrinth of ramps, steps, ladders, painted wheels...[which created] a 'workplace for the actors' and not a space of decoration" (Sellars, p.18). In other words, Popova made the stage perfomance much more engaging for both the actors and the viewers themselves by creating 3-dimensional spaces. This required actors to move around more and interact with their environment or space, and viewers to be much more focused keeping up with the perfomance's pace. Meyerhold and Popova also took advantage of music and light to enhance the theatrical experience.

Lastly, Automatic Rain can perhaps be an example of Gesamtkunstwerk. Automatic Rain combines the art and beauty of nature, which inspired JODI to create this art piece in the first place. Furthermore, a photograph of rain and code is used to create this work of art. Code was organized in a manner that mimics rain. The numbers were colored blue and have a toggling effect.

Bambi is one of my favorite childhood movies. It always made me sad when Bambi lost his mother and kept searching for her. -->
