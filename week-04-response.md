An image that would be read differently if it was in another medium, would be an image taken by an influencer while he/she helped someone else in need. For instance, often there are influencers that record themselves or take pictures with people that they helped. They show the money or type of food that they will be handing out. Sometimes these influencers give take-out-food or small snacks in a plastic bag with a sandwich and coke. As a result, these influences are often criticized for sharing this to the public as they are seen as only doing this act of generosity for publicity. However, if this image or act was instead painted by someone else who had observed this act of generosity, the painting would be a representation of a beautiful, authentic, and pure moment that was handedly and meticulously painted by someone inspired. Furthermore, the linguistic message would consist of the denoted (literal) message, which would be that the items given are money and food; the connoted (symbolic) message would be that this money and food is being gifted to those in need because they are items that tend to make life easier. In other words, the linguistic message might be that this act of generosity is just a one-time thing since the money or food given won't last forever, but they are to at least help momentarily.
