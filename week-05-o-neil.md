# O'Neil WMD Example

WMD stands for Weapons of Math Destruction, which are essentially math models that affect the most vulnerable people in society, such as lower income communities. These models are often unquestioned and cause real destructive outcomes. One example that O'Neil describes as a WMD, is the teacher evaluation tool called IMPACT created by Princeton-based Mathematica Policy Research. Initially, the tool was to improve student performance by hiring better qualified teachers. To do this, the assessment made it "easier" to get rid of teachers that were not performing at the high standard that was expected. As a result of this assessment, 306 teachers were fired, one being Sarah Wysocki.

Wysocki had worked in MacFarland Middle School, until she got fired after scoring very low in her assessment. Effectively, O'Neil puts into perspective the fact that it is very difficult to reduce a teacher's ability and comportment to a simple numerical score. Furthermore, several comparisons are made between a well done statistical system to the teacher evaluation tool to emphasize the inaccuracy of this evaluation. For instance, it is mentioned that for a more successful statistical system, there needs to be a large quantity of subjects to avoid outliers. However, the amount of students being assessed - and determining the quality/future of the teacher - are only about thirty students. It is no wonder that many teachers like Wysocki are disproportionally fired without even being assessed in a just manner.

Additionally, a critical component of a successful statistical system involves receiving feedback. Statistical systems often receive feedback because it benefits it. If something is not working well or is favorable, it is useful to get feedback to know what issue to fix and improve it. In contrast, IMPACT assessment does not welcome feedback. There is no guarantee that the assessment is even evaluating a teacher's ability accurately because the model is not being questioned, tested, reviewed, or challenged. Notably, although many teachers gave up on attempting to get an explanation for how and what IMPACT evaluates, Sarah Bax managed to push through. It was revealed - through her meeting with a district administrator - that he did not even have an answer as to why is the assessment successful in evaluating a teacher. As claimed in the reading, "And as a rule, they let the machines do the talking" (O'Neil, ch.1). In other words, there is no fundamental reasoning, explanation, or evidence that supports that the assessment is reflecting a teacher's capability successfully.
