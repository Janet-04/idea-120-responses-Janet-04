# Murray Response
I personally believe that Murray's predictions were successful since most did end up becoming a reality years later. For instance, she predicted that the television and computer would merge into one, which is what we were essentially seeing in the Mandalorian example. Television shows and movies are becoming more and more realistic for both the viewer and the actors. Computers are used to create the realistic scenes shown on television by manipulating settings, such as daylight and objects being displayed. Manipulating the scene in this way facilitates achieving a desired outcome much more attainable and budget-friendly. Nobody would have to fly to a desired setting to shoot a scene. This is what Murray discussed when she said, "the compelling spatial reality of the computer will also lead to virtual environments that are extensions of the fictional world" (Murray, p. 235). Furthermore, because the producers of Mandalorian decided to use LED screens instead of green screens, the actor gets to also experience the virtual world in which he/she is acting in and being viewed in. In other words, only the viewer got to see the actor in their environment while watching the movie/show, but now the actor gets to immerse within the environment in which they are acting in as well. As Murray stated, "...a virtual set design would be an extension of the dialogue and dramatic action, deepening the immersive illusion of the story world" (Murray, p. 235). Using LED screens avoids the risk of green light "spilling" into the scene, as seen in productions using green screen. Since actors are fully surrounded by the environment displayed through LED screens, the lighting that is projected on the actor makes the virtual world appear much more realistic for the viewer. The viewer's experience is taken to a whole other level since what is being presented will appear real and natural. The viewer's experience won't be jeopardized by a green screen incident. As a result, the viewer's experience also becomes immersive, as it is for the actor. One notable thing that Murray was not successful in predicting was the interaction of the viewer with a movie. There is no movie shown on television that a viewer can choose to follow a certain character's story. However, I would not be surprised if something like this does happen in the near future with movies because there is already something similar within video games.
