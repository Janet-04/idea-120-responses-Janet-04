# Chalabi and O'Neil Response

One of the methods Mona Chalabi mentions are polls. I think I have been exposed to polls because numerous times I have seen data of how effective certain hair or acne products are for many women. Also, I think what facilitates me being exposed to these advertisements are what Cathy O'Neil discusses as competing ads and the advancement of natural-language machine. For instance, I remember first being exposed to a "personalized shampoo" ad on Facebook, and I was extremely intrigued because it was a shampoo made with ingredients that favored the goals I had for my hair. I went to their website many times to take their survey to make my custom shampoo, but never actually got it. Multiple times after, I saw many versions of the same advertisement for this product, and even a few influencers I followed began to advertise this shampoo. Still, years later, I get advertisements every once in a while. Also I think using the College Board website exposed me to certain things, such as being contacted numerous of times to apply for the military. Not that long ago actually, like two weeks ago, I got the most disturbing message yet. Whenever I got contacted through my phone number, I was usually just asked to apply to get recruited, but no other personal information was mentioned about me. However, two weeks ago, I got another message wanting to recruit me for the military, but greeted me with my actual first name and knew I was currently an undergraduate.

I honestly think that it is not favorable to lean more on either side because on the one hand, if things are left as they are right now, people will continue to get scammed and misinformed. However, if these methods were to completely be eliminated, then it would be hard for small-businesses, for example, to stand out within a large pool of businesses. In other words, bigger businesses have specialized workers, and often many of them, to advertise their products in various different ways. However, a small-business does not have as much of a budget to have specialized ad workers, so eliminating targeted ads can affect them greatly since their advertising rate is not as constant already. Therefore, some sort of balance has to be made and major revisions on particular methods, which disproportionally affect low-income populations of color.
