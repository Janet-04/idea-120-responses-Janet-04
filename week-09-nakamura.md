What I think Nakamura's citation is saying is that when we are surfing the Internet or a particular website, we are essentially walking through the thought process of the producer who made the website. In other words, a website or social media platform are almost like a visual, digitized form of a producer's mind. This means that since a website or social media platform is associated with a producer, this comes with all the biases that a producer might have. Therefore, the producer's way of thinking or opinion, will reflect on their website or social media platform. We would be able to see their point of view through interacting with their platform. One great example is when we interact with a web page, clicking through arrows or tabs for a desired outcome. For instance, the reading's example of Jennifer Lopez's music video, where she was being viewed through the gaze of a male and she was being seen as the Latina body. The man would interact with Jennifer Lopez's website to click on the desired videos of her. 

 Facebook is a reflection of the designer's mental structure and their own identity because of how features in the social media platform were pre-established by the designer. Certain features within the app hint towards the push of capitalism and race/class categories. For example, there are many clickable tabs and other buttons to navigate around the app that appear to be reflection of perhaps, the designer's capitalist view. This is what was referred in the reading as, "...to click on a box is to acquire it, to choose it, to replace one set of images with another in a friction-free transaction...". The latter is true because you can click to any, for example, celebrities' page and view all the photos, videos, or posts you want and all for free. Social media platforms and many other forms of interactive media, provide - what seems - free choice for the viewer to view anything. However, there is always a limitation because all the clickable tabs were already placed by the designer and the viewer cannot do anything beyond what already exists for them to view. Also, Facebook's designer has had the option for users to be able to personalize their bio more and can add their race or ethnicity, which already categorizes the user into a particular social group.
