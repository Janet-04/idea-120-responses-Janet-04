# Anna Anthropy Response

Having accessibility to gaming and coding can improve video games by a lot. For instance, Anna Anthropy significantly emphasizes throughout the reading the fact that video games have been both created by and consumed by the same small group of people. The latter tends to be young, educated, white men. Therefore, video game creation and consumption has been in a constant cycle of being created and consumed by the same group of people and as a result, no new designs, content, or players are being created and welcomed. This explains why Anthropy cannot find games that are relevant to her because no games are being made for a transgendered audience; most games are created for heterosexual, white males.

Furthermore, creating video games has been limited to a smaller group of people because game publishers and designers need a college education, which is not affordable to a lot of people. With the rise of the Internet, creating games has become more widely available to a broader audience because no college-education is needed. In other words, there are now free tools in the Internet, such as Scratch and Twine, that facilitates game creation because no extensive coding knowledge is needed. Since Internet is available in the comfort of one's own home, anyone can create a game if they want to. Since the Internet is always available anywhere and any time, people can work on a game whenever they have spare time. As a result, game creation has become more and more diverse, which allows for more different stories and backgrounds.

If more people from different classes, age, and education created games, it can also invite new players. Anthropy makes a good point by saying how video games have become more and more complex, both in their storylines and design. Also, video games have become more time-consuming to create and its gameplay. Because of the latter, the audience targeted for video games are primarily for young people since they do not have responsibilities like most adults do. In short, anyone who is not young and a male, are often excluded from playing most games in the market today.

One way in which theater can use games for their benefit, is by creating a game for a particular story they want, and look at all the outcomes possible. Also, it can facilitate organizing these outcomes. The latter applies as well to a writer or author who may want to organize they storyline, since often details can be left out, especially in books series. Furthermore, an author can benefit from using games to engage their audience even more, by allowing them to interact with the story and not simply consuming it all the time.
