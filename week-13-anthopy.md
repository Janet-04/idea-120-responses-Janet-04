# Anthropy Chapters 3 & 4 Response

Having read Anthropy's chapters last week and this week, this week's has especially made me ask more how are games suppose to be created by more diverse people and experiences? In other words, if some new, diverse games are released and the creator(s) intend for them to be a success, how are the games suppose to be successful if they run the risk of being disliked for their "abnormal" content? Anthropy emphasized, especially in the third chapter, how the stories in games can communicate the creator's values and perspectives. For instance, Tobias Wrigstad created Gang Rape, a role-playing game, in which players got to navigate through the experiences of an attacker and victim of rape. The goal of the creator was to design a game that put into perspective the horror that comes with engaging or being subjected in this atrocious act. This would be a game that would definitely cause controversy. Some people might agree that this game has a good message, and others might find it disrespectful, horrifying, or degrading to make a game of such topic.

As a result, the latter made me think about my initial question. If games, such as Gang Rape, are processed like a regular digital video game and released through a publisher's approval, how can a person like Tobias Wrigstad ensure that his game will be successful? As I am thinking more about this question, perhaps beginning to release more diverse games into the mainstream, does not actually have to mean that is has to be successful right away. Perhaps a creator or publisher would decide to risk it all and release a game like Gang Rape. It possibly takes a risk-taking publisher to release a game that might stir controversy or may not sell many copies of the game, but over time it may encourage other game creators to do the same for their own games. As a result, creating more personal and diverse games can become more of the norm to mainstream video games, and become more successful as they are more widely accepted over time.

Furthermore, the only other way I can think of people creating more diverse games and reaching mainstream, would be if these small creators are acknowledged by bigger game companies, who can aid them. I am actually curious to learn if the latter has happened to games I may know about today. I believe that games created by small creators can be helped to bring their diverse experiences into the mainstream, if big game companies recognized them. In other words, big game companies could collaborate with the creator to perhaps further enhance the game and aid in advertising it. However, I also feel like this could go the wrong way, and big companies might just take credit for the game, as many big companies do.
